## Introduction
 Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant
 attention for its capability in segmenting and tracking object
 instances across video frames. However, most of the existing
 VIS methods unrealistically assume that the categories of
 object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they expe
rience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required
 to continuously learn object instances belonging to new
 classes. To address the above challenges, we develop a novel
 Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model, which
 alleviates catastrophic forgetting of old classes from both
 frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mit
igate forgetting at the frame level, we devise a task-specific
 frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC)
 module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
 task-specific global instance information for new classes in
 each individual frame by projecting its gradients onto the
 orthogonal feature space of old classes. Furthermore, to ad
dress forgetting at the video level, we design a task-specific
 video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
 embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames
 into the frame prompt features, and then propagates task
specific global video contexts from the frame prompt features
 to the video prompt. The effectiveness of our HVPL model
 is demonstrated through extensive experiments, in which
 it outperforms baseline methods.

##   Updates
* **`Aug 21, 2025`:** 沁解沁解沁 Code and pretrained weights are now available! Thanks for your patience :)
* **`Jun 26, 2025`:** 沁解沁解沁 HVPL is accepted to ICCV 2025! 


## Installation

See [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).

## Getting Started

We provide a script `train_net_hvpl.py`, that is made to train all the configs provided in HVPL.

To train a model with "train_net_hvpl.py" on VIS, first
setup the corresponding datasets following
[Preparing Datasets for HVPL](./datasets/README.md).

## Train 

1. Step t=0: Training the model for base classes (you can skip this process if you use pre-trained weights.)
2. Step t>1: Training the model for novel classes with HVPL

| YouTubeVIS 2021 30-10 |  `bash yvis_2021_30_10.sh`  | 
|                       |                             | 
|       OVIS 15-5       |     `bash OVIS_15_5.sh`     |  
|      OVIS 15-10       |    `bash OVIS_15_10.sh`     |  

## Eval
Note that during training, testing will be performed, generating a corresponding `result.json` file as well as a `.txt` file for saving the evaluation metrics (AP縲、P<sub>50</sub>縲、P<sub>75</sub>縲、R<sub>1</sub>).

To validate the forgetting (F) metric (FAP縲：AR<sub>1</sub>)., please run `dataset_eval.py`.
